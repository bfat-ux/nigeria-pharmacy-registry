## Notes & Methodology

- **Coverage %** is estimated by comparing ingested facility counts against PCN/NHIA published totals where available.
- **LGA counts** use the official 774 LGA delineation.
- Records counted are pre-deduplication unless noted. Post-dedup counts come from Agent 3.
- This report is regenerated after each ingestion batch.
